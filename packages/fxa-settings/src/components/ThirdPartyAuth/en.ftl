## ThirdPartyAuth component
## This is a component that is used to display a list of third party providers (Apple, Google, etc.)

# This appears when a user has the option to authenticate via third party accounts in addition to their Firefox account.
# Firefox account login appears on top, and third party options appear on bottom.
# This string appears as a separation between the two, in the following order: "Enter your password" "Or"(this string) (continue-with-google-button with aria equivalent text) / (continue-with-apple-button with aria equivalent text)
third-party-auth-options-or = or

# For the sign-in page, when 3rd-party auth is the only option, this string appears with a divider line between the user's avatar on top and 3rd-party authentication buttons (continue-with-google continue-with-apple buttons) on bottom.
# This could also be translated as "Sign in with the following" or "Sign in with the below".

continue-with-google-button = Continue with { -brand-google }
continue-with-apple-button = Continue with { -brand-apple }
