# fxa-event-broker

The Firefox Accounts Event Broker (fxa-event-broker) is a webhook event delivery
system for events in Firefox Accounts. These events are currently consumed from an
internal priviledged queue that FxA services publish to, screened to determine what
Relying Parties (RPs) should receive them, then distributed via webhooks using the
[Security Event Token (SET)][set] format.

This event broker also stores event metadata, tracking which RPs a user has logged
into to screen event delivery to relevant RPs.

## Relying Party Event Format

A relying party will get webhook calls for events. These events are encoded in
[SET][set]s with the following formats. See the [SET RFC][set] for definitions and other
examples.

### Password Change

Sent when a user has reset or changed their password. Services receiving this event
should terminate user login sessions that were established prior to the event.

- Event Identifier
  - `https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/password-change`
- Event Payload
  - [Password Event Identifier]
    - changeTime
      - Time when the password reset took place. All logins established before this
        time should be terminated.

### Example Password Change Event

    {
     "iss": "https://accounts.firefox.com/",
     "sub": "FXA_USER_ID",
     "aud": "REMOTE_SYSTEM",
     "iat": 1565720808,
     "jti": "e19ed6c5-4816-4171-aa43-56ffe80dbda1",
     "events": {
       "https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/password-change": {
           "changeTime": 1565721242227
       }
     }

### Profile Change

Sent when a user has changed their profile data in some manner. Updates to their
profile may include a new primary email address, display name, or 2FA status. This
event does not include what changed and the profile data a service has access to
may not show any changes if the data changed was outside the OAuth scope the service
was granted.

Services should update any cached profile data they hold about the user.

- Event Identifier
  - `https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/profile-change`
- Event Payload
  - [Profile Event Identifier]
    - `{}`

### Example Profile Change Event

    {
     "iss": "https://accounts.firefox.com/",
     "sub": "FXA_USER_ID",
     "aud": "REMOTE_SYSTEM",
     "iat": 1565720808,
     "jti": "e19ed6c5-4816-4171-aa43-56ffe80dbda1",
     "events": {
       "https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/profile-change": {}
     }

### Subscription State Change

Sent when a user's subscription state has changed to RPs that provide the changed
subscription capability.

**NOTE**: There are strict requirements about subscription state change handling
based on the `changeTime` as documented below.

- Event Identifier
  - `https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/subscription-state-change`
- Event Payload
  - [Subscription Event Identifier]
    - capabilities
      - List of subscription capabilities
    - isActive
      - Boolean indicating if the subscription should be considered active or not
        for the subscription capabilities provided.
    - changeTime
      - Time in seconds when the state change occured in the payment system.
        This value MUST be tracked by the receiving system, and events with a
        changeTime older than the last tracked time MUST be discarded.

### Example Subscription State Change Event

    {
     "iss": "https://accounts.firefox.com/",
     "sub": "FXA_USER_ID",
     "aud": "REMOTE_SYSTEM",
     "iat": 1565720808,
     "jti": "e19ed6c5-4816-4171-aa43-56ffe80dbda1",
     "events": {
       "https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/subscription-state-change": {
           "capabilities": ["capability_1", "capability_2"],
           "isActive": true,
           "changeTime": 1565721242227
       }
     }

### Delete User

Sent when a user has been deleted from Firefox Accounts. RPs MUST delete all user
records for the given user when receiving this event.

- Event Identifier
  - `https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/delete-user`
- Event Payload
  - [Delete Event Identifier]
    - `{}`

### Example Delete Event

    {
     "iss": "https://accounts.firefox.com/",
     "sub": "FXA_USER_ID",
     "aud": "REMOTE_SYSTEM",
     "iat": 1565720810,
     "jti": "1b3d623a-300a-4ab8-9241-855c35586809",
     "events": {
       "https://schemas.accounts.firefox.com/event/delete-user": {}
     }

## Deployment

### Metrics

The Event Broker emits statsD style metrics. A statsD compatible host should be
defined to capture these. All timings are in milliseconds.

| Event Name                  | Type    | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message.processing.total`  | Timing  | Total time spent processing a service notification.             |
| `message.queueDelay`        | Timing  | Time the event was in the service notification queue.           |
| `proxy.sub.queueDelay`      | Timing  | Time the event was in the PubSub proxy queue.                   |
| `message.sub.eventDelay`    | Timing  | Time from Stripe subscription event until processed from queue. |
| `proxy.sub.eventDelay`      | Timing  | Time from Stripe subscription event until delivered to RP.      |
| `message.type.subscription` | Counter | Subscription notification events.                               |
| `message.type.login`        | Counter | Login notification events.                                      |
| `message.type.delete`       | Counter | Delete notification events.                                     |
| `proxy.success.CID.STATUS`  | Counter | Successful event delivery to a RP.                              |
| `proxy.fail.CID.STATUS`     | Counter | Failed event delivery to a RP.                                  |

`CID` - Client Id of Relying Party.

### Testing a Webhook URL

To verify that a webhookUrl can process a payload correctly, the simulator can
be used to generate a simulated JWT signed payload. The relying party can verify
this worked correctly before a full deployment occurs.

Command Syntax:

    node dist/bin/simulate-webhook-call.js CLIENTID WEBHOOKURL CAPABILITIES

Where `CAPABILITIES` is a comma-seperated string of capabilities to include.

#### Usage

```bash
$ npm run build
$ export LOG_FORMAT=pretty
$ node dist/bin/simulate-webhook-call.js a9238ba https://example.com/webhook capability_1
fxa-event-broker.simulateWebhookCall.INFO: webhookCall {"statusCode":200,"body":"ok\n"}
$
```

## Software Architecture

The event-broker [architecture document](./architecture.md) describes the overall flow of data
from fxa-auth-server via SQS into event-broker and back out to relying parties (RPs). The [mermaid] diagrams
found there can be copied into the [mermaid live editor] to view. Extensions
[are available for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bpruitt-goddard.mermaid-markdown-syntax-highlighting) and other editors that allow local previews
of the diagrams.

### Code Organization

- `bin/` - Program directory (Note the runnable versions will be under `dist/` when compiled)
  - `generate-sqs-traffic` - Create a stream of SQS events for a local test run.
  - `simulate-webhook-call` - Webhook URL testing script to verify correct webhook handling.
  - `worker` - Primary entry point for running the event-broker in production.
  - `workerDev` - Development version of event-broker that uses FxA daemons pm2 starts.
- `config/` - Configuration loader and `.json` files for runtime environments.
- `lib/`
  - `api/` - Hapi-based HTTP API that Google PubSub publishes to which proxies the
    requests out to RP's.
  - `db/` - Database handlers for storing RP's a user has logged into and user events.
  - `selfUpdatingService/` - Global objects used by the HTTP API and SQS processor which automatically
    update themselves with the latest webhook URLs for RPs and current subscription
    capabilities for each RP.
  - `jwts` - JWT generator for the [Security Event Tokens][set] defined above that are sent to RPs.
  - `notificationProcessor` - SQS notification processor that parses [FxA Service Notifications][fxasp],
    creates a new event, then fans it out to Google PubSub queues for each RP it
    should be delivered to.
  - `proxy-server` - HTTP API server setup for above `api/`.
  - `result` - Result interface.
  - `sentry` - Sentry error handling configuration/setup for SQS processor and HTTP API.
  - `serviceNotification` - [FxA Service Notification][fxasp] message validation and type extraction.
  - `version` - Version loading for HTTP API version check endpoint.
- `test` - Unit tests, organized in matching heirarchy with the root event-broker directory.
- `types` - Additional TypeScript definitions for dependencies missing type information.

## Testing

This package uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to test its code. By default `npm test` will test all files ending in `.spec.ts` under `src/test/` and uses `ts-node` so it can process TypeScript files.

Test specific tests with the following commands:

```bash
# Test only src/test/lib/db/firestore.spec.ts
npx mocha -r ts-node/register src/test/lib/db/firestore.spec.ts

# Grep for "queries on start"
npx mocha -r ts-node/register src/test/**/** -g "queries on start"
```

Refer to Mocha's [CLI documentation](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage) for more advanced test configuration.
