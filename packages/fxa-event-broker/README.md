# fxa-event-broker

The Firefox Accounts Event Broker (fxa-event-broker) is a webhook event delivery
system for events in Firefox Accounts. These events are currently consumed from an
internal priviledged queue that FxA services publish to, screened to determine what
Relying Parties (RPs) should receive them, then distributed via webhooks using the
[Security Event Token (SET)][set] format.

This event broker also stores event metadata, tracking which RPs a user has logged
into to screen event delivery to relevant RPs.

## Event Format

The events delivered to relying parties (as SETs) and the raw internal SNS/SQS event
stream this broker consumes are both documented in one place — see
[Account Events](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/reference/account-events)
on the ecosystem platform site, which describes each event identifier, its payload, and
the SET envelope. For RP-side integration steps (registering an endpoint and verifying
signatures), see
[Integrating with FxA](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/relying-parties/tutorials/integrating-with-fxa).

## Deployment

### Metrics

The Event Broker emits statsD style metrics. A statsD compatible host should be
defined to capture these. All timings are in milliseconds.

| Event Name                  | Type    | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message.processing.total`  | Timing  | Total time spent processing a service notification.             |
| `message.queueDelay`        | Timing  | Time the event was in the service notification queue.           |
| `proxy.sub.queueDelay`      | Timing  | Time the event was in the PubSub proxy queue.                   |
| `message.sub.eventDelay`    | Timing  | Time from Stripe subscription event until processed from queue. |
| `proxy.sub.eventDelay`      | Timing  | Time from Stripe subscription event until delivered to RP.      |
| `message.type.subscription` | Counter | Subscription notification events.                               |
| `message.type.login`        | Counter | Login notification events.                                      |
| `message.type.delete`       | Counter | Delete notification events.                                     |
| `proxy.success.CID.STATUS`  | Counter | Successful event delivery to a RP.                              |
| `proxy.fail.CID.STATUS`     | Counter | Failed event delivery to a RP.                                  |

`CID` - Client Id of Relying Party.

### Testing a Webhook URL

To verify that a webhookUrl can process a payload correctly, the simulator can
be used to generate a simulated JWT signed payload. The relying party can verify
this worked correctly before a full deployment occurs.

Command Syntax:

    node dist/scripts/simulate-webhook-call.js CLIENTID WEBHOOKURL CAPABILITIES

Where `CAPABILITIES` is a comma-seperated string of capabilities to include.

#### Usage

```bash
$ yarn build
$ export LOG_FORMAT=pretty
$ node dist/scripts/simulate-webhook-call.js a9238ba https://example.com/webhook capability_1
fxa-event-broker.simulateWebhookCall.INFO: webhookCall {"statusCode":200,"body":"ok\n"}
$
```

## Software Architecture

The event-broker [architecture document](./architecture.md) describes the overall flow of data
from fxa-auth-server via SQS into event-broker and back out to relying parties (RPs). The [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams
found there can be copied into the [mermaid live editor] to view. Extensions
[are available for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bpruitt-goddard.mermaid-markdown-syntax-highlighting) and other editors that allow local previews
of the diagrams.

This package is built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and follows module/service/providor patterns as documented for a NestJS project.

## Testing

This package uses [Jest](https://mochajs.org/) to test its code. By default `yarn test` will test all files ending in `.spec.ts`.

Test commands:

```bash
# Test with coverage
yarn test-cov

# Test on file change
yarn test-watch
```
