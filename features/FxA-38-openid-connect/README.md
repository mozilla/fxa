# OpenID Connect

https://mozilla.aha.io/features/FXA-38

## Stories

As a developer of a relying service, I want to delegate authentication and user profile data to Firefox Accounts via a standard protocol with good documentation and library support, so that I can focus on building my service without learning about a bespoke authentication protocol.

## Outcomes

We shipped spec-compliant support for the OIDC 'code' flow in FxA train-53, in January 2016.

The discovery URL mechanism has proven useful for new reliers integrating with Firefox Accounts,
as they can avoid hard-coding multiple URLs in their application.

Unfortunately, ecosystem/library support for OIDC does not seem to be very mature,
and we did not see the hoped-for gains in "plug-and-play" integration using off-the-shelf
libraries.  We will consider follow-up work on library support and potentially implementing
additional flows in the future.

## Details

### `openid` Scope and `id_token`

[OpenID Connect][spec] is a small layer on top of OAuth2. We are already largely compatible with OAuth2, and so the only addition needed to make us compliant with OpenID Connect is to add a `openid` scope, and return an `id_token` when that scope is requested.

The `id_token` is a [JWT][jwt], with the following example:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://accounts.firefox.com",
  "sub": "5901bd09376fadaa076afacef5251b6a",
  "aud": "https://marketplace.firefox.com",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "auth_time": 1311280969
}
```

The [spec][] says that additional Claims may be included in the `id_token`, such as `email`, `nickname`, `picture`, etc. These Claims don't have to be part of the token, however. They can also be fetched from the `UserInfo` endpoint.

The spec is unclear when it should be part of the `id_token`, and when it should not be. Perhaps it is up to each implementation to decide.

### Discovery

Instead of looking in our documentation to try to find each endpoint, we can use the parts of the [Discovery][] spec to have a single endpoint describing the rest of our OpenID Connect service.

This would be a JSON document located at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

An example document:

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://accounts.firefox.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://oauth.accounts.firefox.com/v1/authorization",
  "token_endpoint": "https://oauth.accounts.firefox.com/v1/token",
  "response_types_supported": ["code", "id_token", "token"],
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://profile.accounts.firefox.com/v1/profile",
  "jwks_uri": "https://oauth.accounts.firefox.com/v1/.well-known/jwks.json"
}

```
