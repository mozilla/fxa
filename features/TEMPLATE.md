# [ Feature Title ]

> You can include context or meta-data here if needed.
> For example, links to past features or bugs,
> or links to dashboards that spurred this feature into action.

> For example, here's a Google Docs version of this template:
> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGaLTwPYA6AmxJ8EssuMyNoErsgun4vPOcC-ijfixIY/


## Problem Summary

> Talk about current goals of the system and how they aren't being met.
> What outcomes are we not delivering?
> This can also include an explicit request for improvement
> that doesn't dictate a specific or concrete solution.

> What user problem(s) are we trying to resolve?

> This is a good place for user stories,
> but don't feel forced into writing an awkward one
> just to fill in the space.


### Assumptions (optional)

> This is where you talk about what you assume to be true.
> This could include assumptions around what users are doing,
> errors, gaps, etc., based on anecdotes, opinions, testing, or data.

## Outcomes

> What are the outcomes you want to achieve? What is the success criteria?

## Hypothesis

> A high level hypothesis of how the feature you're proposing
> is going help us achieve the outcomes listed above.
> Ideally this be a sentence of the form:

> If we (do this/build this/create this experience)
> for (these users),
> then we will see (this outcome)
> because we have observed (previous evidence)
> from (data source, URL, survey, etc).

## Metrics

> What is the primary success metric to confirm hypothesis?
> Be precise and explicit, preferably by providing a sample aritfact or graph.

> Are there secondary success metrics
> which could potentially prevent this feature from rolling out?

> How will these metrics be measured? (tool, data source, visualization, etc.)
> Do we have baseline values already?

> **Please provide sample artifact graphs.**

****

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.
> Explain in enough detail to try to make it readable to someone outside of the team
> (other PMs, executives, etc) or for someone joining the team.

> An additional goal is to reduce any doubt within the interpretation of metrics we might collect.
> This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

### Original Version (Present Day)

> What is the current situation in regards to this feature?
> How does it currently work?
> No need to go in as much detail as the suggested change but just enough
> to provide contrast and more context. Screenshots and user flow can often be enough.

### Variation A

> Provide details of change.
> If this is one of multiple variations,
> why do we think this change will make the better improvement.
> Include:
>  * Screenshots with appropriate explanation
>  * User flow

### Variation B

> Like Variation A.
> Set out as many variations as necessary.


## Unresolved questions and risks (optional)

> What parts of the design are still TBD?

## Results

> If we are developing a hypothesis and defining success metrics,
> we need to log them here.
> If metrics leave room to interpretation, define them.
> (e.g. when are they tracked, how, etc)
> Include screenshots of result graphs or data tables.
> These results will likely help us develop new hypotheses!

## Conclusion

> Was our hypothesis true or false and why?
> Our hypothesis was true because we observed... [e.g. a 15% increase in account signup completions].

> We should also address secondary metrics here:
> We also observed during this test that…  [e.g. we had an increase in single device signups]

## Next Steps

> There no point having a conclusion if you don’t have take-aways with next steps.
> Are we releasing? Are we making changes?
