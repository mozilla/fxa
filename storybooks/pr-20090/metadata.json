  "summary": "bug(auth): Fix polluted sentry captures",
  "description": "Because:\n- We would see context from other errors cross pollinate\n- In auth server error capture was particularly poor\n\nThis Commit:\n- Removes old cruft that is no longer needed with sentry 10\n- Now that Sentry uses, OTEL under the hood makes necessary adjustments to our OTEL initialization\n- Adds handler for testing / validating this works\n- Updates logic to ensure proper initialization of both OTEL and Sentry.\n- Makes adjustments to libs/shared to keep things aligned\n- Stops writing requests to error object. This now happens via the integration.\n- Sets the user state on the error",
