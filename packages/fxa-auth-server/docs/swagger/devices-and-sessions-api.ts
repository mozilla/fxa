      ðŸ”’ Authenticated with session token

      Returns an array listing all the clients connected to the authenticated user's account, including devices, OAuth clients, and web sessions.

      This endpoint is primarily designed to power the "devices and apps" view on the user's account settings page.

      It will only return active sessions. For example, if a user has signed into a service and then later disconnects from that service via account settings connected devices, they would not appear on this list.

      Depending on the type of client, it will have at least one and possibly several of the following properties:

      - \`clientId\`: The OAuth client_id of the connected application.
      - \`sessionTokenId\`: The id of the \`sessionToken\` held by that client, if any.
      - \`refreshTokenId\`: The id of the OAuth \`refreshToken\` held by that client, if any.
      - \`deviceId\`: The id of the client's device record, if it has registered one.

      These identifiers can be passed to [/account/attached_client/destroy](#tag/Devices-and-Sessions/operation/getAccountAttached_clients) in order to disconnect the client.

      This endpoint returns a maximum 500 last used devices and sessions.

      ðŸ”’ Authenticated with session token

      Destroy all tokens held by a connected client, disconnecting it from the user's account.

      This endpoint is designed to be used in conjunction with [/account/attached_clients](#tag/Devices-and-Sessions/operation/getAccountAttached_clients). It accepts as the request body an object in the same format as returned by that endpoing, and will disconnect that client from the user's account.

      ðŸ”’ Authenticated with session token or OAuth refresh token

      Creates or updates the [device registration](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/main/packages/fxa-auth-server/docs/device_registration.md) record associated with the auth token used for this request. At least one of \`name\`, \`type\`, \`pushCallback\` or the tuple \`{ pushCallback, pushPublicKey, pushAuthKey }\` must be present. Beware that if you provide \`pushCallback\` without the pair \`{ pushPublicKey, pushAuthKey }\`, both of those keys will be reset to the empty string.

      \`pushEndpointExpired\` will be reset to false on update if the tuple \`{ pushCallback, pushPublicKey, pushAuthKey }\` is specified.

      Devices should register with this endpoint before attempting to access the user's sync data, so that an appropriate device name can be made available to other connected devices.
