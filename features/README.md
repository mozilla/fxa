# Feature description cards for Firefox Accounts.

This directory is our
lightweight planning and tracking mechanism
for new feature development in Firefox Accounts.

Each sub-directory named "FxA-XX-YYY"
corresponds to a feature card in the
[features waffleboard](https://waffle.io/mozilla/fxa-features)
and provides the details of
how the feature will look and behave,
how it will be implemented,
and how we'll determine whether it was successful.

Proposing a new feature?
You should start by filing an issue in the
[features waffleboard](https://waffle.io/mozilla/fxa-features)
for discussion.
Once you're ready to specify things in detail,
you can use the [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) and [TEMPLATE_CLEAN.md](TEMPLATE_CLEAN.md)
files from this directory to get started with a PR.
