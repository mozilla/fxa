      ðŸ”’ Authenticated with session token

      Returns the 'verified' status for the account's recovery email address.

      Currently, each account is associated with exactly one email address. This address must be verified before the account can be used (specifically, \`GET /account/keys\` will return errors until the address is verified). In the future, this may be expanded to include multiple addresses, and/or alternate types of recovery methods (e.g. SMS). A new API will be provided for this extra functionality.

      This call is used to determine the current state (verified or unverified) of the account. During account creation, until the address is verified, the agent can poll this method to discover when it should proceed with  \`GET /account/keys\`.

      ðŸ”’ Authenticated with session token

      Re-sends a verification code to the account's recovery email address. The code is first sent when the account is created, but if the user thinks the message was lost or accidentally deleted, they can request a new message to be sent via this endpoint. The new message will contain the same code as the original message. When this code is provided to \`/v1/recovery_email/verify_code\`, the email will be marked as 'verified'.

      This endpoint may send a verification email to the user. Callers may optionally provide the \`service\` parameter to indicate what identity-attached service they're acting on behalf of. This is an opaque alphanumeric token that will be embedded in the verification link as a query parameter.

      Verify tokens and/or recovery emails for an account. If a valid token code is detected, the account email and tokens will be set to verified. If a valid email code is detected, the email will be marked as verified.

      The verification code will be a random token, delivered in the fragment identifier of a URL sent to the user's email address. Navigating to the URL opens a page that extracts the code from the fragment identifier and performs a POST to \`/recovery_email/verify_code\`. The link can be clicked from any browser, not just the one being attached to the Firefox account.
