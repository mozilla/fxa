## Types

# Parameters

The types of each parameter is shown in brackets below. In some cases an extra clarification
is shown afterwards.

- number - a number (integer only)
- string - a string of undetermined length
- Buffer - a Buffer of undetermined length
- Buffer16 - a Buffer of length 16 bytes
- Buffer32 - a Buffer of length 32 bytes
- Buffer64 - a Buffer of length 64 bytes

The storage backends are not meant to be clever. They never infer anything and they shouldn't
default anything. The `fxa-auth-server` defaults everything it needs to. Backends shouldn't
default anything in code or in the datastore (either by default values or triggers).

Please note that when a parameter type is specified as `Buffer` you can choose whether to store as a binary type or as
a hex encoded string. This decision will depend on what your storage backend can do or if it is faster with one or the
other. e.g. the `mysql` backend stores these fields as `binary(??)`. The test `memory` backend stores these as
hex encoded strings.

# Promises

All functions return a promise. Even if we are just returning a value it is wrapped
in a promise so that you can chain calls if you need to.

## .createAccount(uid, data)

Parameters:

- uid - (Buffer16) the uid of the account to be created - unique
- data:
  - email - (string)
  - normalizedEmail - (string) the same as above but `.toLowerCase()`
  - emailCode - (Buffer16)
  - emailVerified - (number) 0|1, to show whether an account has been verified
  - createdAt - (number) an epoch, such as that created with `Date.now()`
  - verifyHash - (Buffer32)
  - authSalt - (Buffer32)
  - wrapWrapKb - (Buffer32)

  - verifierVersion - (number) currently always set to 1, may be 2 or more in the future

Returns:

- success - always returns an empty object when successful
- error (can be either):
  - a `error.duplicate()` if this uid already exists
  - an error from the underlying storage system

## .account(uid)

Parameters:

- uid - (Buffer16) the uid of the account to be created - unique

Returns:

- data:

- error (can be either):
  - a `error.notFound()` if this account does not exist
  - an error from the underlying storage system

## .checkPassword(uid, hash)

Parameters:

- uid - (Buffer16) the uid of the account to be queried
- hash:

Returns:

- resolves with:
  - an empty object `{}`

  - `error.notFound()` if the credentials are invalid
  - any error from the underlying storage engine

## .verifyEmail(uid, emailCode)

Parameters:

- uid - (Buffer16) the uid of the account to be queried
- emailCode - (Buffer16) the emailCode of the email to be verified

Returns:

- success - returns an empty object

We do not separate the fact that the account uid may not exist and always
resolve to an empty object. Verify Email will check both the account
and email table for specified emailCode and verify it.

## Tokens

All tokens (sessionTokens, keyFetchTokens, passwordForgotTokens, passwordChangeTokens, accountResetTokens) have three
functions which all work similarly. For example, the `sessionTokens` have:

### .createSessionToken(tokenId, token)

### .createKeyFetchToken(tokenId, token)

### .createPasswordChangeToken(tokenId, token)

### .createPasswordForgotToken(tokenId, token)

Parameters.

- tokenId : (Buffer32) the unique id for this token
- token : (Object) the fields to be stored in the token (see below for each token type)

Each token takes the following fields for it's create method respectively:

- sessionToken : data, uid, createdAt, uaBrowser, uaBrowserVersion, uaOS, uaOSVersion, uaDeviceType,
  uaFormFactor, mustVerify, tokenVerificationId, tokenVerificationCodeHash, tokenVerificationCodeExpiresAt
- keyFetchToken : authKey, uid, keyBundle, createdAt, tokenVerificationId
- passwordChangeToken : data, uid, createdAt
- passwordForgotToken : data, uid, passCode, createdAt, triesxb

Returns:

- resolves with:
  - an object `{}`
- rejects with:
  - `error.duplicate()` if a token already exists with the same `tokenId`
  - any error from the underlying storage system (wrapped in `error.wrap()`

Note: for some tokens there should only ever be one row per `uid`. This applies to `accountResetTokens`,
`passwordForgotTokens` and `passwordChangeTokens`. In the MySql driver we currently use `REPLACE INTO ...` so you
should do something equivalent with your storage backend.

### .sessionToken(tokenId)

### .keyFetchToken(tokenId)

### .keyFetchTokenWithVerificationStatus(tokenId)

### .passwordChangeToken(tokenId)

### .passwordForgotToken(tokenId)

### .accountResetToken(tokenId)

Parameters:

- `tokenId` - (Buffer32) the id of the token to retrieve

Returns:

- resolves with:
  - an object `{ ... }` with the relevant field (see below)
- rejects with:
  - `error.notFound()` if this token does not exist
  - any error from the underlying storage system (wrapped in `error.wrap()`

Each token returns different fields.
These fields are represented as
`t.*` for a field from the token,
`a.*` for a field from the corresponding account and
`d.*` for a field from `devices` and
`ut.*` for a field from `unverifiedTokens`.

The deviceCallbackPublicKey and deviceCallbackAuthKey fields are urlsafe-base64 strings, you can learn more about their format [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/web-push-encryption).

- sessionToken : t.tokenData, t.uid, t.createdAt, t.uaBrowser, t.uaBrowserVersion,
  t.uaOS, t.uaOSVersion, t.uaDeviceType, t.uaFormFactor, t.lastAccessTime,
  a.emailVerified, a.email, a.emailCode, a.verifierSetAt,
  a.createdAt AS accountCreatedAt, d.id AS deviceId,
  d.name AS deviceName, d.type AS deviceType,
  d.createdAt AS deviceCreatedAt, d.callbackURL AS deviceCallbackURL,
  d.callbackPublicKey AS deviceCallbackPublicKey,
  d.callbackAuthKey AS deviceCallbackAuthKey,
  d.callbackIsExpired AS deviceCallbackIsExpired,
  d.capabilities AS deviceCapabilities,
  ut.mustVerify, ut.tokenVerificationId
- keyFetchToken : t.authKey, t.uid, t.keyBundle, t.createdAt, a.emailVerified, a.verifierSetAt
- keyFetchTokenWithVerificationStatus : t.authKey, t.uid, t.keyBundle, t.createdAt, a.emailVerified,
  a.verifierSetAt, ut.mustVerify, ut.tokenVerificationId
- passwordChangeToken : t.tokenData, t.uid, t.createdAt, a.verifierSetAt
- passwordForgotToken : t.tokenData, t.uid, t.createdAt, t.passCode, t.tries, a.email, a.verifierSetAt
- accountResetToken : t.uid, t.tokenData, t.createdAt, a.verifierSetAt

### .deleteSessionToken(tokenId)

### .deleteKeyFetchToken(tokenId)

### .deletePasswordChangeToken(tokenId)

### .deletePasswordForgotToken(tokenId)

### .deleteAccountResetToken(tokenId)

Will delete the token of the correct type designated by the given `tokenId`.
For `sessionTokens`,
associated records in `devices` and `unverifiedTokens`
will also be deleted.

## .verifyTokens(tokenVerificationId, accountData)

`accountData` is an object
with a `uid` property.

Returns a promise that:

the verification method on the sessions table.

`tokenData` is an object
with a `verificationMethod` property.

Verification methods currently supported are `email, email-2fa, totp-2fa`.

Returns a promise that:

- Resolves with an object `{}`
  if a token was verified.
- Rejects with error `{ code: 404, errno: 116 }`
  if there was no matching token.
- Rejects with any error
  from the underlying storage system
  (wrapped in `error.wrap()`).

## .verifyTokenCode(code, accountData)

Verifies sessionTokens and keyFetchTokens.
Note that it takes the code (separate from tokenVerificationId)
specified when creating the token,

  if token expired.
- Rejects with any error
  from the underlying storage system
  (wrapped in `error.wrap()`).

1. deletes the `passwordForgotToken` corresponding to the `tokenId`
2. creates an `accountResetToken` corresponding to the fields specified in `accountResetToken`
