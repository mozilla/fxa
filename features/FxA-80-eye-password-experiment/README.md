Eye Password Experiment
========================

https://mozilla.aha.io/features/FXA-80

Firefox Account users are struggling immensely when changing their passwords.

![Change Password Statistics](change-password-stats.png)

We would like to learn if users who show the password field are struggling less, and also learn if a new toggle style is more successful. We may use results to inform a choice about show password in platform.

## Control UX
Currently the show password toggles are synchronized. We should remove this for the experiment.

## Treatment 1 UX

* When the user hovers over the eye icon and the password is masked, there should be a link title on the eye that says "Show password"
* When the user hovers over the eye icon and the password is unmasked, there should be a link title on the eye that says "Hide password"
* The eye color matches our current smokey grey and blue colors.
* When the user clicks the eye and the password is masked, the password becomes unmasked.
* When the user clicks the eye and the password is unmasked, the password becomes masked.

## Treatment 1b Variant UX

* When the user hovers over the eye icon and the password is masked, there should be a link title on the eye that says "Show password"
* Windows-style: Only while the user is clicking the eye, does the password become unmasked.

* The eye color matches our current smokey grey and blue colors.

* When the user clicks the eyeglasses and the password is unmasked, the password becomes masked.
