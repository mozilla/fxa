      Requests a 'reset password' code to be sent to the user's recovery email. The user should type this code into the agent, which will then submit it to \`POST /password/forgot/verify_code\`.

      The code will be either 8 or 16 digits long, with the length indicated in the response. The email will either contain the code itself or the URL for a web page that displays the code.

      The response includes \`passwordForgotToken\`, which must be submitted with the code to \`POST /password/forgot/verify_code\`.

      The response also specifies the TTL of \`passwordForgotToken\` and an upper limit on the number of times the token may be submitted. By limiting the number of submission attempts, we also limit an attacker's ability to guess the code. After the token expires, or the maximum number of submissions has been made, the agent must call this endpoint again to generate a new code and token pair.

      Each account can have at most one \`passwordForgotToken\` valid at a time. Calling this endpoint causes existing tokens to be invalidated and a new one created. Each token is associated with a specific code, so by extension the codes are invalidated with their tokens.

      Resends the email from \`POST /password/forgot/send_code\`, for use when the original email has been lost or accidentally deleted.

      This endpoint requires the \`passwordForgotToken\` returned in the original response, so only the original client which started the process may request a resent message. The response will match that from \`POST /password/forgot/send_code\`, except \`ttl\` will be lower to indicate the shorter validity period. \`tries\` will also be lower if \`POST /password/forgot/verify_code\` has been called.
