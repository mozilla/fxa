## Testing webhook callbacks for message status updates

Important Tip! To manually test webhook callbacks isn't super straight forward. Per Twilio's docs the best way to manually test is as follows.

1. Use ngrok to reverse proxy: ngrok http 9000
2. Whatever url ngrok spits out, update the auth server configuration to use this value plus `/v1/recovery_phone/status` as the twilio webHook url value. eg.
   `RECOVERY_PHONE__TWILIO__WEBHOOK_URL=https://YOUR_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN.ngrok-free.app/v1/recovery_phone/status`
3. Start up the server again `dotenv -- yarn restart auth --update-env`. Or the whole stack if you are starting from scratch `dotenv -- yarn start`.
4. Create an account
5. Enable 2FA
6. Register a recovery phone
7. Watch the logs, you'll see twilio making the call back to the `/v1/recovery_phone/status` end point.

(Based on, https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/test-your-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok-html)

Also it's good to note that there are some caveats about configuration for webhooks. If you have an twilio authToken in used, the webhook will validate
the `X-Twilio-Signature` header. If you are using twilio API keys, then we need the fxaPublicKey/fxaPrivateKey pair set in the config. Reach
out to a teammate for this value, or generate one yourself. There's a method that will do this in the `util.ts`. And make sure this key pair
is in the config!
