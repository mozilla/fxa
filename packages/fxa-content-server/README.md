## Quick Start

Clone the repository, make sure you have [required prerequisites](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-local-dev#dependencies) installed.
Run `npm install` and `npm run start-remote`.
This will start a local fxa-content-server on [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) that works with remote Firefox Accounts servers.

If you want to install all Firefox Accounts servers locally follow the instructions on:
[fxa-local-dev](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-local-dev) to get a full development setup running.
Please note that fxa-local-dev is the preferred way of contributing to Firefox Accounts.

## Testing

### Functional Tests

ðŸ“– A much more thorough breakdown of Content Server functional tests can be found in our [Ecosystem Platform docs](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/docs/fxa-engineering/functional-testing).

**[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [JRE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) is required to run functional tests.**

This package uses Selenium to perform functional tests. By default `npm test` will run all functional tests under `tests/`. You can run specific tests with the following commands:

```bash
# Grep for "change password, sign in with new password"
npm run test -- --grep="change password, sign in with new password"
```

#### Changing the Auth Server

To change the default Auth Server edit `server/config/*.json` on your deployed instance.

```json
{
  "fxaccount_url": "http://your.auth.server.here.org"
}
```

**Note that testing with Selenium via Docker does _not_ work at present, so all testing must be carried out via your normal operating system's npm & Java tooling.**

#### Using xvfb

On headless systems that can't spawn Firefox for use with Selenium, `xvfb-run` may be used for a virtual framebuffer for Firefox
to run with. After installing `xvfb-run` the functional tests can be run with:

```sh
xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1920x1200x16" npm run test-functional
```

### Unit Tests

If you'd like to run only unit tests you can do so in your browser by navigating to <http://localhost:3030/tests/index.html>. You can also grep for specific tests by specifying the `grep` URL parameter (e.g. <http://localhost:3030/tests/index.html?grep=fxa-client>).

## Grunt Commands

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used to run common tasks to build, test, and run local servers.

| TASK                  | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grunt build`         | build production resources. See [task source](grunttasks/build.js) for more documentation                                  |
| `grunt clean`         | remove any built production resources.                                                                                     |
| `grunt lint`          | run ESLint, Sass-lint, amdcheck and JSONLint on client side and testing JavaScript.                                        |
| `grunt server`        | run a local server running on port 3030 with development resources.                                                        |
| `grunt server:dist`   | run a local server running on port 3030 with production resources. Production resources will be built as part of the task. |
| `grunt test`          | run local Intern tests.                                                                                                    |
| `grunt version`       | stamp a new minor version. Updates the version number and creates a new CHANGELOG.md.                                      |
| `grunt version:patch` | stamp a new patch version. Updates the version number and creates a new CHANGELOG.md.                                      |
