## Summary

This top section summarizes the terms below. This summary is provided to help your understanding of the terms, but be sure to read the entire document, because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of the terms, not just this summary.

* Mozilla accounts (the "Services") include your account and the suite of services provided to you by Mozilla using that account.
* The Services are provided "as is" and there are no warranties of any kind. There are significant limits on Mozilla's liability for any damages arising from your use of the Services.

## Terms of Service

1. #### Introduction

    These Terms of Service ("<u>Terms</u>") govern your use of Mozilla accounts, a suite of online services provided by Mozilla (the "Services").

2. #### Mozilla Accounts

    In order to use some of the Services, you'll need to create a Mozilla account. You must be 13 years old or older to create a Mozilla account. During registration, you will be asked to set a password. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and for the activity that happens through your Mozilla account. Mozilla is not responsible for any losses arising out of unauthorized use of your Mozilla account.

3. #### Services 

    (a) Mozilla VPN is a Virtual Private Network in partnership with [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/). A Mozilla account is required.
    
    (b) Firefox Relay allows you to keep your primary email address safe and private from online services by making unique, alias email addresses that allow you to send and receive emails without revealing your primary email address. A Mozilla account is required.
    
    (c) Firefox Monitor is an informational service to promote online security by informing you of public data breaches. You can scan email addresses on our website to see most publicly known breaches. If you subscribe with a Mozilla account, you will receive: 

    * Full Report: This includes a complete list of publicly known hacks, including breaches of sensitive websites, such as those for children or adult and dating sites (these sites are excluded from website scans in order to protect the privacy of those individuals). 
    * Breach Alerts: This notifies you if your email address appears in a new data breach. 
    * Safety Tips: This sends you occasional online safety tips from Mozilla.

    It is your responsibility to protect your online accounts using strong and different passwords, security questions, two-factor authentication, password managers, and other safety measures. Although Firefox Monitor and [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) strive to have current data, there is no guarantee that either will have complete or timely records of all public data breaches. 

    (d) Firefox Notes lets you take notes in Firefox. A Mozilla account is required to view, edit, and delete your Notes across devices. 

    (e) Firefox sync lets you access information stored in Firefox across devices, including your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and browser preferences. You can enable and disable Firefox sync through the Settings section of Firefox. A Mozilla account is required. 
    
    (f) Pocket helps you discover great content that’s personalized to your interests and save this content so you can return to it later – on any device, at any time. 

4. #### Privacy Policy

5. #### Communications

You may also choose to receive other types of email messages. 
    
    You can change your email subscriptions with Mozilla from our emails (click the link at the bottom) or from the browser (visit Firefox / Preferences / Sync / Manage account / Email Preferences).
    
    We may also send you important account information such as updates to legal or privacy terms, or security messages like password resets, email verification, and linked devices. These are necessary to our services and cannot be unsubscribed from.

7. #### Mozilla's Proprietary Rights

    Mozilla does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the Services that are not specifically stated in these Terms.

8. #### Term; Termination

    These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or Mozilla. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deleting your Mozilla account, discontinuing your use of the Services, and if applicable, unsubscribing from our emails. 

    We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your Mozilla account or the next time you attempt to access the Services.

    In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability, Miscellaneous.

9. #### Indemnification

    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its contractors, contributors, licensors, and partners, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of the Services  (including, but not limited to, from any content uploaded by you).

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR CONTENT IS DELETED OR CORRUPTED OR THAT SOMEONE ELSE ACCESSES YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT AND INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

11. #### Modifications to these Terms

    Mozilla may update these Terms from time to time to address a new Service, feature of the Services, or to clarify a provision. The updated Terms will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of this page.

    These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these terms and the English language version, the English language version shall control.
