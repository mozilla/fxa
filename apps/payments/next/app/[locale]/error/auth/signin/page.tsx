 * no prompt signin is attempted on a user thats not currently signed into FxA.
 *
 * In situations like this, ideally the customer should be redirected to the
 * appropriate checkout page in a "signed out" state. To achieve this the
 * authjs.callback-url cookie is read to retrieve the correct redirect url,
 * otherwise it's not possible to know what offering and interval the customer
 * was attempting to reach.
