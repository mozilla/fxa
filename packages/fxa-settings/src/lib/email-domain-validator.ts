/**
 * This validates an email address's domain through DNS lookups.
 *
 * The validation is performed after the existing account email check during
 * the form submission process. At this point, the email address has gone
 * through: 1) regex validation, 2) an email mask check, and 3) existing
 * email address check.
 *
 * Prior to sending the email domain to the server side, it is checked against
 * a list of known top domains. If the domain is found in the list, then the
 * process is skipped.
 *
 * There are three possible validation results: 'MX', 'A', and 'none'.
 *  - 'MX': MX record exists, proceed
 *  - 'A': no MX, but A record exists, display tooltip but allow submission
 *  - 'none: neither MX or A records found, block submission
 *
 * If the validation request itself fails, we allow the submission to
 * continue.
